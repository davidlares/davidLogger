Encoding / Encrypting Header
--
Base64: is an encoding procedure
0. Single base64 encoding
1. Adding Salts (cold keys) for later decryption
2. Re-encoding with the salts

How it works? (my own words)

- Transfer bytes to Human Readable Strings: a-z (upper-lower) and numbers, filling 62 chars out of 64
- Aditionally may use: + (char 63) and / (char 64) for indexes (starts with 0 index)
- There's a mandatory pattern char that's equal sized, used to the label encoding string for patting 
- all characters are printable, and every char can be represented in only base64 characters
- transfered without any data loss

Algorithms Example:

"Man" => "TwFu"
M = 77 (ASCII value) = 01001101
a = 97 (ASCII value) = 01100001
n = 110  (ASCII value) = 01101110

Combined is: 010011010110000101101110 
 - the actual length is 24, and should be grouped in groups of 6 because 2 (pow) 6 = 64 (BASE 64)
 - resulting (binary split):
	1. 010011: 19 (in decimals) => T (encoded string)
	2. 101110: 22 (in decimals) => W (encoded string)
	3. 000101: 5 (in decimals) => F (encoded string)
	4. 101110: 46 (in decimals) => u (encoded string)

It can be reversed, is not encrypted, is encoded.
